HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

 🔹 Project Overview
This project predicts employee attrition using IBM HR Analytics dataset and provides actionable insights for HR management. It combines **Python-based analytics**, **machine learning modeling**, and **Power BI visualizations**.

##  Objectives
- Predict which employees are likely to leave.
- Identify key factors influencing attrition.
- Provide a visual dashboard for HR decision-making.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Power BI Desktop
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Import dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and correlations.
4. **Model Building**: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree.
5. **Model Explainability**: Identify important factors (e.g., Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income).
6. **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations of attrition trends.
7. **Insights & Recommendations**: Actionable strategies to reduce attrition.

## Deliverables
- `HR_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb` → Python notebook with full analysis
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` → Dashboard file
- `Report.pdf` → Detailed project report
- `Small_Report_PPT.pptx` → Presentation summarizing the project

##  Key Insights
- Employees with **low job satisfaction** and **high overtime** are 60% more prone to attrition.
- Certain departments like **Sales & HR** show higher turnover rates.
- Salary bands and promotion history significantly impact attrition trends.

## 
1. Open the Jupyter notebook for step-by-step analysis.
2. Open Power BI `.pbix` file to explore the dashboard interactively.
3. Refer to `Report.pdf` for insights and recommendations.
